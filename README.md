# ComplexNN
This repository contains all the Complex Neural Network implementation.(with two backpropagation approaches), tested on iris, moon and circle dataset.
Objectives:
1.Manipulated in layer calculations of complex neural
networks.
2.Discovered Inverse Neural Networks.
3.Inverse Neural Networks handle non-linearity better than
generic models.
4.Written a research paper on Inverse Neural Networks.

Datasets to be tested are present in Non-linear datasets. Refer.
